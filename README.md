## Installation

The `.jar` and `.exe` files are too large to be uploaded to Github.
The files can be accessed in the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IXfk2Qg4Vm9qNClR1s0epMEj3EMkLxuk?usp=sharing).
## Deployment

Simply opening the `How2Prog.exe` file starts the game.

###
Another alternative way to start the program is by opening the `How2Prog.jar`. It works similar to `How2Prog.exe`.

###
For running the raw java files, the main class of the program is `How2Prog.java` as reference.
