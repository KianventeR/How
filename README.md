## Installation

The `.jar` and `.exe` files are too large to be uploaded to Github.
The files can be accessed in the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IXfk2Qg4Vm9qNClR1s0epMEj3EMkLxuk?usp=sharing).
## Deployment

Simply opening the `How2Prog.exe` file starts the game.

###
Opening the game using the `How2Prog.jar` file is only possible through the console/terminal.

Enter the following:
```bash
  java --enable-preview -jar How2Prog.jar
```

###
For running the raw java files, the main class of the program is `How2Prog.java`.
